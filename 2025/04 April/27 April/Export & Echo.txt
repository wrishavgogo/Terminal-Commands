export SPARK_HOME=/Users/w0b01mk/Desktop/DataEngineering/spark-3.5.5-bin-hadoop3


âœ… This created a new environment variable called SPARK_HOME, and set its value to your Spark folder path.

âœ… In simple words:

Environment variables are key-value pairs that your shell and programs can use or read.

âœ… export made sure:
SPARK_HOME is available to your current terminal session
Programs and scripts you run can access SPARK_HOME

echo $SPARK_HOME
âœ… echo simply prints whatever you ask it to print.
âœ… $SPARK_HOME means:
Fetch the value of the environment variable SPARK_HOME.
âœ… So what happened?
Your terminal printed /Users/w0b01mk/Desktop/DataEngineering/spark-3.5.5-bin-hadoop3

That shows: your SPARK_HOME was successfully created in memory for this session.
